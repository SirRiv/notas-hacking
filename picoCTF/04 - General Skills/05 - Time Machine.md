## Descripción
#### Description

What was I last working on? I remember writing a note to help me remember...You can download the challenge files here:

- [challenge.zip](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c_titan/161/challenge.zip)

Hints: 
1. The `cat` command will let you read a file, but that won't help you here!
2. Read the chapter on Git from the picoPrimer [here](https://primer.picoctf.org/#_git_version_control).
3. When committing a file with git, a message can (and should) be included.
