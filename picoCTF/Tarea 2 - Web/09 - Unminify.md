Hints:
1. Try CTRL+U / ⌘+U in your browser to view the page source. You can also add 'view-source:' before the URL, or try `curl <URL>` in your shell.
2. Minification reduces the size of code, but does not change its functionality.
3. What tools do developers use when working on a website? Many text editors and browsers include formatting.
